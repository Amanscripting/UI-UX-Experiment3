# UI-UX-Experiment3

## Aim:
Heuristic Evaluation of an Existing Website or App
## Algorithm:
Step 1: Define Evaluation Scope

Select 2–3 competing apps/websites

Define:

Target users

Core tasks (e.g., login, search, checkout)

Set evaluation goals:

Usability

Efficiency

Accessibility

Visual clarity

Step 2: Select Heuristic Principles

Use standard usability heuristics (e.g., Nielsen’s Heuristics):

Visibility of system status

Match between system & real world

User control & freedom

Consistency & standards

Error prevention

Recognition rather than recall

Flexibility & efficiency

Aesthetic & minimalist design

Error recovery

Help & documentation

Step 3: Perform Heuristic Evaluation for Each App

FOR each selected app/website:

Navigate through key user flows

Evaluate each screen using heuristic checklist

Identify usability issues

Assign severity rating:

1 = Cosmetic

2 = Minor

3 = Major

4 = Critical

Document findings with screenshots

END FOR

Step 4: Comparative Analysis

Create comparison table:

Features

Navigation

Visual design

Loading speed

Error handling

Accessibility

Identify:

Best performing app

Most usability issues

Unique strengths

Step 5: Identify UX Gaps

Detect missing features

Identify friction points

Highlight inconsistencies

List accessibility problems

Step 6: Develop Improvement Plan

FOR each identified issue:

Propose UI changes

Suggest interaction improvements

Apply usability principles

Ensure consistency across platforms

END FOR

Step 7: Redesign Key Screens

Create improved wireframes

Apply:

Gestalt principles

Better hierarchy

Clear CTA buttons

Improve:

Navigation flow

Error messages

Feedback mechanisms

Step 8: Validate Improvements

Conduct usability testing

Compare:

Task completion time

Error rate

User satisfaction

Refine design

Step 9: Final Documentation

Include:

✔ Heuristic checklist
✔ Severity ratings
✔ Comparative analysis table
✔ Before/After design changes
✔ Justification for improvements
